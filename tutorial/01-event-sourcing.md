### Event Sourcing

Event sourcing is a software design pattern in which the state of an application is stored as a sequence of events. In other words, instead of storing the current state of an application in a database, event sourcing stores all the changes that have been made to the application's state as a series of events.

The eventeur code could be used to implement event sourcing in a Go application. The Publish and Subscribe methods could be used to store and retrieve events, and the EventeurEventHandler function could be used to apply events to the application's state.
